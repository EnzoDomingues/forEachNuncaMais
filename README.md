.forEach() NEVER more!
======================

Let's improve our javascript skills by taking 5 functions that you probably know
and use them in a better way to write a much more readable, reusable and declarative 
code instead of an imperative one.

You'll be surprised to learn that this 5 simple functions can make the most of 
operations with collections. 

So, that said, why still using `forEach()` and build gigantic-confusing-code-blocks
when you can build a much more elegant one?
